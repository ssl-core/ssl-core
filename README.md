# ssl-core

This repository contains RobÃ´CIn's next yet-to-be-developed software for the RoboCup Small Size Soccer.

Its conception consists of a long-term project that tries to apply the concept of microservices to robotics, taking the utmost care to meet the latency and resource management requirements that exist in the category, exploring the single responsibility principle so that each service has an isolated purpose.

## About

The `ssl-core` project is organized as a language-agnostic monorepo package-by-feature microservices. Top-level directories contains its own `README.md` and are individually responsible for describing its purpose.

## System Requirements

All the code developed was done in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with development tied to a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), making it platform-independent.

## Codemap

* [`experiments`](experiments/README.md)

  Contains experiments and prototypes for conceptual validation.

* [`vision-be`](vision-be/README.md)

  Contains the vision microservice.

* [`common`](common/README.md)

  Contains common code and utilities used across the project.

* [`.cmake`](.cmake/README.md)

  Contains common [CMake](https://cmake.org) rules and utilities used across the project.

* [`protocols`](protocols/README.md)

  Contains the [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) definitions used across the project.

* [`docs`](docs/README.md)

  Contains documentation pages as guides, tutorials, and other useful information.

## How to Contribute
