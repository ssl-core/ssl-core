## [`concepts`](concepts.h)

The [concepts](concepts.h) header provides a set of concepts extending the standard library.

- `protobufish`: a concept for types generated by the [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev) compiler;
- `arithmetic`: a concept that represents a type that is either an integral or floating point type;
- `fundamentalish`: a concept for types that are fundamental, i.e., `std::is_fundamental_v<T>` (that is, `arithmetic` type, `void`, or `std::nullptr_t`), see [std::is_fundamental](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_fundamental);
- `stringish`: a concept for types that are string-like, i.e., `std::is_convertible_v<T, std::string_view>`, see [std::string_view](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view);
- `optionalish`: a concept for types that are optional-like, i.e., with the same interface as `std::optional`, see [std::optional](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional).

## [`epsilon`](epsilon.h.in)

The [epsilon](epsilon.h.in) is a [CMake configure file](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/configure_file.html)
that defines the epsilon value passed to CMake during project build through the `ROBOCIN_FLOAT_EPSILON`,
`ROBOCIN_DOUBLE_EPSILON` and `ROBOCIN_LONG_DOUBLE_EPSILON` flags (see [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)).

These values will be used by the library to perform real number comparisons.

* The existence of these values can be verified as follows:

```cpp
robocin::has_epsilon<float>::value;
robocin::has_epsilon<double>::value;
robocin::has_epsilon<long double>::value;
```

or:

```cpp
robocin::has_epsilon_v<float>;
robocin::has_epsilon_v<double>;
robocin::has_epsilon_v<long double>;
```

* When provided, you can access them without using:

```cpp
robocin::has_epsilon<float>::epsilon;
robocin::has_epsilon<double>::epsilon;
robocin::has_epsilon<long double>::epsilon;
```

or:

```cpp
robocin::epsilon_v<float>;
robocin::epsilon_v<double>;
robocin::epsilon_v<long double>;
```

## [`fuzzy_compare`](fuzzy_compare.h)

The [fuzzy_compare](fuzzy_compare.h) header provides a set of functions to perform fuzzy comparisons and functor classes
to be used with the standard library algorithms. There are many ways to compare real numbers, but for the applications
that RobôCIn and other robotics teams use, the way chosen is to compare the absolute difference against
a [tolerance margin](#epsilon):

```cpp
// returns true if a floating point number 'is zero':
std::abs(value) <= epsilon;

// returns true if two floating point numbers 'are equal':
std::abs(lhs - rhs) <= epsilon;
```

- `fuzzyIsZero`: returns true if a floating point number is close to zero;
- `fuzzyCmpEqual`: returns true if two floating point numbers are close to each other;
- `fuzzyCmpNotEqual`: returns true if two floating point numbers are not close to each other;
- `fuzzyCmpThreeWay`: returns true if two floating point numbers are close to each other, returning a C++20 three-way
  comparison result (see
  [Three-way comparison](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_comparison#Three-way_comparison));
- `fuzzyCmpLess`: returns true if a floating point number is less than another;
- `fuzzyCmpLessEqual`: returns true if a floating point number is less than or equal to another;
- `fuzzyCmpGreater`: returns true if a floating point number is greater than another;
- `fuzzyCmpGreaterEqual`: returns true if a floating point number is greater than or equal to another.
- Functors:
    - `FuzzyIsZero`: functor that returns true if a floating point number is close to zero;
    - `FuzzyEqualTo`: functor that returns true if two floating point numbers are close to each other;
    - `FuzzyNotEqualTo`: functor that returns true if two floating point numbers are not close to each other;
    - `FuzzyThreeWay`: functor to perform a three-way comparison between two floating point numbers;
    - `FuzzyLess`: functor that returns true if a floating point number is less than another;
    - `FuzzyLessEqual`: functor that returns true if a floating point number is less than or equal to another;
    - `FuzzyGreater`: functor that returns true if a floating point number is greater than another;
    - `FuzzyGreaterEqual`: functor that returns true if a floating point number is greater than or equal to another.

> **Note**: The `fuzzy*` functions / `Fuzzy*` functors with implicit epsilon are only available when
> the [epsilon](#epsilon) is defined.
> Otherwise, you must explicitly pass the epsilon value to the function / during construction.

## [`type_traits`](type_traits.h)

The [type_traits](type_traits.h) header provides a set of type traits extended the standard library.

- `common_floating_point_for_comparison`: a type trait that represents the common floating point type for comparison
  between two arithmetic types (the tolerance of the lowest precision floating point is prioritized);
    - `common_floating_point_for_comparison_t`: a helper alias for `common_floating_point_for_comparison::type`;
