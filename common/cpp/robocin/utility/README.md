- `protobufish`: a concept for types generated by the [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev) compiler;

- `fundamentalish`: a concept for types that are fundamental, i.e., `std::is_fundamental_v<T>` (that is, `arithmetic` type, `void`, or `std::nullptr_t`), see [std::is_fundamental](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_fundamental);

- `stringish`: a concept for types that are string-like, i.e., `std::is_convertible_v<T, std::string_view>`, see [std::string_view](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view);

- `optionalish`: a concept for types that are optional-like, i.e., with the same interface as `std::optional`, see [std::optional](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional).
