# experiments

This folder provides a collection of experiments made for validation of specific architecture requirements.

## Gateway

The [gateway](gateway) folder contains different implementations of the gateway as the middlebox between frontend and backend.

It is strongly based in [ZeroMQ](https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/preface/) concepts - a framework to distributed application - and even though each approach has it's own documentation, further knowledge may be needed (see [ZeroMQ socket documentation](https://libzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zmq_socket.html) to improve understanding and readability).
